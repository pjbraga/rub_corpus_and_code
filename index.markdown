RUB Corpus and Code are two downloadable, open-source collections. 

The [RUB Corpus](/rub_corpus_and_code/corpus/) is a collection of Russian-language official government speeches, interviews, and press releases made by top policymakers in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus from 2006 to 2016. 

The [Code](/rub_corpus_and_code/code/) represents the programs used to compile the RUB Corpus and to conduct a lexicon-based sentiment analysis upon the RUB Corpus.

The sentiment analysis was conducted using a modified version of the lexicon created by [Loukachevitch and Levchik (2016)](http://www.labinform.ru/pub/rusentilex/index.htm).

Both the RUB Corpus and Code can be downloaded from their respective website pages (see the [Corpus](/rub_corpus_and_code/corpus/) and [Code](/rub_corpus_and_code/code/) links on the navigation bar), or they can be downloaded from this website's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pjbraga/rub_corpus_and_code).
